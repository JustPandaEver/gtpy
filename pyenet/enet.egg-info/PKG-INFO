# pyenet

### This is a personal fork made to work for one of my projects. I suggest you use the original repository instead.

pyenet is a python wrapper for the ENet library by Lee Salzman,
http://enet.bespin.org

It was originally written by Scott Robinson <scott@tranzoa.com> and is
currently maintained by Andrew Resch <andrewresch@gmail.com>

## License
pyenet is licensed under the BSD license, see LICENSE for details.
enet is licensed under the MIT license, see http://enet.bespin.org/License.html

## Dependencies

Building pyenet requires all the same dependencies as enet plus Cython and,
obviously, Python.

## Installation

The first step is to download the enet sources from http://enet.bespin.org and
extract it to the enet/ directory in pyenet's source directory.  You could also
check out the enet source code from their CVS repository.

This version of pyenet requires enet 1.3.

Next step is to run the setup.py build:
```
$ python setup.py build
```
Once that is complete, install the new pyenet module:
```
$ python setup.py install
```

## Usage

Once you have installed pyenet, you only need to import the enet module to
start using enet in your project.

Example server:
```py
>>> import enet
>>> host = enet.Host(enet.Address("localhost", 33333), 1, 0, 0)
>>> event = host.service(0)
```
Example client:
```py
>>> import enet
>>> host = enet.Host(None, 1, 0, 0)
>>> peer = host.connect(enet.Address("localhost", 33333), 1)
```
More information on usage can be obtained from:
 http://enet.bespin.org/Tutorial.html
